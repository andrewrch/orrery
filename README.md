This is a small program written in C, using OpenGL which renders all the
planets in the solar system as well as their moons.

Features
----

*  As you'd expect planets rotate the sun
*  Likewise moons rotate planets
*  Planets orbits and radii are scaled slightly to make them more visible
*  Stars read from HYG database and so are in realistic positions
*  Can toggle asterisms
*  Names displayed above celestial body
*  Planets are textured
*  Free camera
*  Point light from sun's centre casts shadows on planets from their moons

Todo
---

*  Tweak scales slightly - perhaps give up on realism completely and make it 
   prettier
*  Rewrite sun shader to be a bit more exciting
